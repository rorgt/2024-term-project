### GO term enrichment analysis for CLIP and ribosome profiling (Fig 5A)

> GO enrichment analysis for CLIP-seq and ribosome footprinting data. Each circle represents a GO term. The color intensity indicates statistical significance of enrichment or depletion determined by Mann-Whitney U test. The size of the circle corresponds to the number of genes, whereas the coordinates indicate average CLIP tag enrichment (x axis) and ribosome density change (y axis). Balloons contain the number of genes (written in parentheses) and p values for CLIPseq (C) and ribosome footprinting (R). Note that nucleosome-related terms are overestimated artificially in CLIP because of a normalization problem due to the lack of polyA tail in histone mRNAs.

Cho, J. *et al*. LIN28A Is a Suppressor of ER-Associated Translation in Embryonic Stem Cells. *Cell* 151, 765–777 (2012).

### My plan is to trim and filter the data of 'TermProj_2024_1' and then merge it with the GO data.
